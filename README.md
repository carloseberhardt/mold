### Why?
Why not?
Sometimes you just want an easy way to apply a template to an API response. This is that.

### How?
Store your template(s), associate a base url with it, when you request through the proxy we apply the template, as identified via Accept header.

### Anything else?
Not sure.. what else could there be?
