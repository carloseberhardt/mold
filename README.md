modify json responses -- or a fungus

### Why?
Why not? 
Sometimes you just want an easy way to apply a json-template to an API. This is that.

### How?
Store your json template, associate a base url with it, when you request through the proxy we apply the template

### Anything else?
Not sure.. what else could there be?
